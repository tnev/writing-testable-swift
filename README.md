# Writing Testable Swift

One of the hardest parts of our job is certainty. We tend to doubt ourselves and our decisions. Even after we’ve committed our code, and it's in production, we’re not totally sure how it will handle the innumerable use cases it could encounter.

So, what if we didn’t need to harbor this anxiety and instead we could feel confident in our solutions? What if we could be empowered by having a high degree of certainty that our code will work as intended? Well this is possible!

This course is an introduction on how to write clean, robust, and testable Swift code without any third-party dependencies.

If you think that there's other ways to write testable Swift code, then you're right. There's lots of ways to accomplish testable Swift code. I like using the techniques in this course, but I appreciate all the teachers and library creators that have contributed to a community of testable Swift code.
