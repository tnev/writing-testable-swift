# Writing Testable Swift

As software developers, we're making a lot of decisions every day. We're fixing bugs, building new features, and architecting new systems. We have so many choices to make, and sometimes we're not sure if we're making the right one.

So, what if we could feel **confident** in our solutions? What if we could be **empowered** by having a high degree of certainty that our code will work as intended? That is the goal of Writing Testable Swift.

This course is an introduction on how to write clean, robust, and testable Swift code without any third-party dependencies.

There will be four parts to this course. In each part, you'll find a mardown document that contains the course content and a keynote presentation that I use to teach this course.

If you find this course helpful then I encourage you to use this content and teach it! This course is meant to empower developers to write code they can feel confident in. If your co-workers or local iOS meetup could benefit from this content, please feel free to use it.

If you think this course could be improved, corrected or added to, please file an issue or make a PR.

If you think that there's other ways to write testable Swift code, then you're right. I like using the techniques in this course, but I appreciate all the teachers and library creators that have contributed to a community of testable Swift code.
